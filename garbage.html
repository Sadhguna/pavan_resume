				This is a social relevant project. It helps to clean the floating garbage on still water bodies like ponds,lakes etc. Maximum of the human intervention is reduced by this, by sitting at the shore we can control this boat. It collects the garbage into a container which is located on it , once it is filled we can replace that. By using advanced bluetooth modules we can use this for long distances also.

					<div>GEAR MOTOR</div>
					<p class="fo">A gearmotor (or geared motor) is a small electric motor (AC induction, permanent magnet DC, or brushless DC) designed with an integral (non-separable) gear reducer (gearhead) attached. The end shield on the drive end of the motor (light blue, below) is designed to provide a dual function.</p>

					<div>ARDUINO</div>
					<p class="fo">Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards ('shields') or breadboards (for prototyping) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs. The microcontrollers can be programmed using the C and C++ programming languages, using a standard API which is also known as the Arduino language, inspired by the Processing language and used with a modified version of the Processing IDE. In addition to using traditional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment (IDE) and a command line tool developed in Go.</p>

					<div>MOTOR DRIVER</div>
					<p class="fo">Motor drivers acts as an interface between the motors and the control circuits. Motor require high amount of current whereas the controller circuit works on low current signals. So the function of motor drivers is to take a low-current control signal and then turn it into a higher-current signal that can drive a motor.The main function of a motor driver is to provide enough electrical power to the motor to gain torque, speed as per requirement.
                      Motor Driver can control the direction of rotation of the motor.Motor drivers can control the speed of the motor.</p>

					<div>BREAD BOARD</div>
					<p class="fo">A breadboard, solderless breadboard, protoboard, or terminal array board is a construction base used to build semi-permanent prototypes of electronic circuits. Unlike stripboard (Veroboard), breadboards do not require soldering or destruction to tracks and are hence reusable. For this reason, breadboards are also popular with students and in technological education.<br>
				The emitter is simply an IR LED (Light Emitting Diode) and the detector is simply an IR photodiode . Photodiode is sensitive to IR light of the same wavelength which is emitted by the IR LED. When IR light falls on the photodiode, the resistances and the output voltages will change in proportion to the magnitude of the IR light received.</p>

					<div>TWO MODULE RELAY</div>
					<p class="fo">A relay is an electrically operated switch. It consists of a set of input terminals for a single or multiple control signals, and a set of operating contact terminals. The switch may have any number of contacts in multiple contact forms, such as make contacts, break contacts, or combinations thereof.</p>

					<div>HC05 BLUETOOTH MODULE</div>
					<p class="fo" >It is designed to replace cable connections HC-05 uses serial communication to communicate with the electronics. Usually, it is used to connect small devices like mobile phones using a short-range wireless connection to exchange files. It uses the 2.45GHz frequency band.The Bluetooth module is a small range wireless communication device that can be used for various purposes like sending of data or controlling of devices connected with it. Furthermore, it can be interfaced with Arduino Uno and can be used in multiple projects where wireless communication is required for a small range.</p>

					<div>JUMPER WIRES</div>
					<p class="fo">A jump wire (also known as jumper, jumper wire, DuPont wire) is an electrical wire, or group of them in a cable, with a connector or pin at each end (or sometimes without them – simply "tinned"), which is normally used to interconnect the components of a breadboard or other prototype or test circuit, internally or with other equipment or components, without soldering.</p>

					It is controlled with the help of bluetooth(HC05), we will have buttons in the application of our mobile for movenment of the boat. According to the inputs from the user it will respond. The inputs from the user are received by the bluetooth module and it will send those values to the processor(arduino) ,accordingly the processor will respond. If we want to switch on the conveyor belt, then the processor will send 5V to relay, which helps relay to on, then relay will make a connection between batteries and conveyor belt motors. In same way if we want to move the boat, then motor driver will get the information from bluetooth module through processor, according to those values the motor driver will rotate the wheels of the boat.
